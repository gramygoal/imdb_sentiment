"[""Don’t be fooled by the title – this is not a light and fluffy romance.  In fact, it’s quite serious and rather depressing, mostly due to the ML’s complex, prickly personality and his situation (slowly losing his sense of taste and eventually his eyesight) as well as his psychotic business partner, Elise, who is obsessed with him to the point of poisoning him so he's dependent on her.  And if that isn’t enough, Elise and her evil mom are also swindling him out of his restaurant.  One evening, he gets dead drunk, and the ugly witch (FL’s name for her, not mine) makes it appear as though they’ve slept together, and while he’s out, she fraudulently places his thumb print on a legal document.  When dumb ass ML wakes up the next morning, he apparently thinks he’s slept with her and decides to ‘take responsibility’ (at least, that’s what I think he’s doing) and tells her that he’s willing to ‘be with her’.  Fortunately, the ugly witch has enough conscience to turn him down.  I really hate these type of MLs who, because of some relationship in the past or present, passively allow toxic women to cling to them like barnacles, causing strife in his relationship with FL…but heck, it’s ain’t a C-drama without one of these harpies.  I much prefer the rude MLs who treats these women as they should be treated – like toxic waste.  On top of all of this, ML has a professional rival actively looking for ways to humiliate and defeat him.  \n\nThis drama is just full of lot of manipulation, psychotic behavior, deceit, back-stabbing, poor sportsmanship, revenge, unethical practices, etc., and there’s very little romance to make up for all the angst.  ML/FL remind me more of a master and his seeing eye dog than lovers, and it takes forever for them to even get to the point of being a couple.  He’s dealing with his medical condition and all the angst caused by the ugly witch and his professional rival while FL is hung up on her ‘crush’, the idiot playboy, Song Yiran, who ends up with his brother’s pick for his wife anyway.  Honestly, the best part of the drama for me was the song/dance at the very end.\n\nFL, at least, came across as reasonably mature, despite her age.  There was no cutesy behavior such as baby talk or pouting, and she was a solid support for ML as he went through his trials…much of it brought upon himself for trusting that psycho business partner…and no, I didn’t feel sorry for her as she struggled with her evil deeds.  As for the rest of the characters, I’m not going to waste my time commenting.  The good news is – this drama does manage to have a happy ending although far from satisfactory, in my opinion.  The villains (Elise, evil mom, doctor, Elise's brother, FL's cousin) do not get properly punish for their evil deeds, which gives out a horrible message.  Forgiveness is admirable but that doesn't mean you allow criminals to escape the punishment they rightly deserve.  ML nearly dies because of what Elise and the doc does to him so they should have been punished...and no, going into exile in Europe is not proper punishment!\n\nI suppose it was an interesting story if you like angst-filled dramas that make you feel more depressed than light-hearted.  For me, it wasn’t my cup of tea because I watch dramas to escape a reality which already has enough of angst in it.  The premise of this drama was very similar to ‘Instead of Tipsy Why Not Get Drunk’ (also available on Viki) in which a wine expert loses his sense of taste via an accidental kiss and must train the girl who stole his sense of taste to analyze wines on his behalf.  I recommend Tipsy over Cupid’s Kitchen if this plot line appeals to you – it’s not depressing, and there’s plenty of sweet romance between the leads.""]",1
"['I totally agree with mz_jugni. I will add my own comments later.\n\n""I love this show too much! I’m generally more fond of Korean dramas than Chinese dramas for a few reasons. Often, Chinese dramas have so many episodes that the central story gets watered down. Also, while I understand the reason for dubbing in Chinese dramas, the quality can sometimes be sub par and distracting. And, lastly, I personally feel that in an effort to make the FL seem strong and independent, she will often comes across (again, in my opinion) as a prickly, pouting obstinate child. However, in this drama, I’m feeling none of that frustration. Yes, the FL is young and often immature, but she is also thoughtful and sincere. She gives off a vibe that gives me a reason to look forward to watching her character develop and grow as a chef and as a woman. And the chemistry between the ML and the FL is amazing. I hate that there are so many evil people in the drama, but I guess it adds some spice. I just wish I didn’t have to patiently wait for each new episode. This is a series I’d love to spend a weekend binge watching. Oh, and did I mention the ML looks totally hot in his chef’s uniform?\n\nUpdate…while I still love this show and can’t wait to see how it all gets tied up in the end, I’m getting super frustrated with the number of truly evil people in this show who continue to face no consequences for their actions, and worse, that the show tries to normalize them. I won’t go into detail, but if these people hadn’t done such bad things to other people, their side stories would be delightful. But at this point, I can’t enjoy any of it because I’m gritting my teeth wondering when/if they are going to get the punishment they deserve.\n\nUpdate #2…I found this show elsewhere and finished it over the weekend. And I have to say, I have mixed feelings about the ending. Personally, I would have preferred different resolutions for some of the characters. But, I loved the main couple, and I’d watch them again in another show. ""']",1

"['This show could have been better.\nIt has a potentially good script, and most of the cast is good enough to carry it; it also has great visuals and photography dedicated to the art of cooking, which is the best element that\'s being integrated in the narrative... however, this show drastically falls to a 5 stars (should\'ve been 4, but kept one for the female lead and Boris\' actor, Alexei Lezev) because it gives out a very wrong message.\n\nMost people got fed up of this show precisely due to one of the factors that contributes to send out this harmful message: Elise. Leaving aside the obvious lacking skills of the actress that portrays her (that can always improve), the character is drawn a certain way but it doesn\'t get solved realistically. It happens the same with her mother, Jessica (?) Quentin, and a little bit with Kesong\'s cousin, Xiaoyu.\n\nThe premise is that Elise is a psychotic woman who is obsessed with Qianfang/Oliver, the male lead. Because no one that decides to do what she does can be in her right state of mind (and not talking about an illness but a true psychopathy, fuelled by a real narcissistic nature). Her mother is a vicious woman with very bad morals, and her brother also lacks some nobility while being extremely arrogant.\n\nElise decides to poison the man she is obsessed with, so he will get dependant on her and won\'t have any other choice but to be entangled (romantically) to her. Her mother applauds her when she discovers she\'s behind Qianfang\'s loss of taste and even instigates and coaxes her to steal his shares from the bussiness they built together. Victor, the brother, cheats at one point of the cooking competition that occupies grand part of this drama, but he never gets reported not caught by the survilliance cameras that conveniently did work when Kesong (the female lead) ends up fighting with her cousin Xiaoyu... well, everything is too forced for plot device and, I get this comes from a certain genre of Chinese romance novels, but this is not a webtoon, this should be believable and try not to spread the message that if you commit crimes you\'ll go unpunished. Especially when they\'ve spent such a huge budget on making it look like a HQ drama.\n\nThe drama has 40 episodes that could had been 30 or could had been 40 but without dragging certain plotlines this much and showing more of the cooking competition and each contestants (the ones they chose to focus on) journey. To be honest, I stopped caring about Song Yirang (Kesong\'s initial love interest) too soon and, I must admit, his back-story was one trully interesting due to his hedonistic nature and the reason why the kid behaved so immaturely. But it just got boring.\n\nWhat I can\'t fathom is that these dramas go through censorship that cuts on a lot of things that shouldn\'t be persecuted anywhere in the World, yet it gets a free pass to presenting 3 criminals (Elise, her mother and the unethical doctor) that end up not only going unpunished and without any karma lesson to learn, they even get to save the day! Out of them three, the ones that pssd me off the most were Miss Quenting and the doctor. That doctor shouldn\'t be allowed to excercise, and Elise\'s mother should had got some karma coming for her, even if she didn\'t get caught commiting fraud with how she got Qianfang\'s ""signature"" to steal his shares.\n\nElise ""karmic"" journey of feeling super guilty and repentant is not coherent. She is a psycho, nobody that would chose to do what she did can be a person that\'s not absolutely twisted and harmful. They even showed us how she continuesly gaslighted and tried to manipulate him, how are we to believe she\'s just a woman who made the wrong choice? She just kepts commiting crime after crime once she realizes it is too late, yet the drama ends and she\'s no way behind bars. Not even after Qianfang discovers the truth himself.\n\nDespite other aspects of the story were good and worth watching, even the dispared romance (due to the high age difference), since both leads made it work decently; this drama felt like a fraud once it reached its end without the true evildoers recieving what they deserved.']",0
"[""Food, glorious food! This could have been so much better if they just stuck to that theme but alas, the writer took us down the garden path, deep dive a dank rabbit hole, before magically transported us to the Fairy meadow where the unicorns are frolicking like they were on drugs.\nAny reader who has watched the original Karate Kid (and similar movie/show) would recognise the central plot. In this case, instead of martial arts, we have culinary arts. A Michelin star chef needs to find and train a new apprentice, but that person must have a supernatural sense of taste. Of course, this was not done through the kindness of his heart but because he is losing his own ability to taste food, so he needed that someone to taste for him when he creates new dishes. All this is hushed up so people were confused when he decided to mentor a girl (FL) who accidentally entered a top tier cooking competition but can’t cook at all. To compound his woes, he is quite a prickly character and very temperamental. In essence, a stereotypical master craftsman/creative type. All the classic clichés were deployed included the equivalent of the old wax-on-wax-off training trick to bring the hapless FL to some semblance of proficiency. However, this is a rom-com so the tale as old as time was given its due and the master/apprentice relationship took on a much more personal spin. \nSpeaking of food and cooking, this show has so much food porn. From street food to eateries serving local delicacies and all the way up to Michelin star restaurant. The food was a highlight, and those dishes were shot with skill and a singular focus. I do wonder whether the production team hired a food stylist and specialist photographer. This ended up being the saving grace of the show and I gave it extra marks.\nYou may well say there is nothing wrong with that storyline, sounds quite interesting and delicious. That is indeed the case, if they stick to it. However, into that pot were added several antagonists as well as dramatic change in tones. I mean descent into madness type of change. Most of this came from left field so what started as a light and breezy rom-com got darker and darker until you thought you were watching a different genre. \nThe OTP is an odd couple but when all the romantic ducklings are lined up, they can be quite sweet and engaging. You can't deny there is chemistry between them. Towards the end, there are truly swoon worthy moments. It would be tempting fate if this was the only game in town. We are confronted with the typical Chinese rom-com problème du jour, what I'd like to term Too Many Cooks Syndrome. On top of the OTP, there are 5 other CP’s! (Is that a record?) Most of the pairings are contrived and does little for the show other than padding out the runtime and force a change of scenery. This is particularly jarring when the show got darker and more intense. We’d suddenly flip to a CP and watch them do the mating dance or deal with some trivial matter. \nAll these extraneous stuffs would just be fluff if the show didn’t do a 180 on itself at the 7/8 mark. Every antagonist was reformed. Every problem (except the one concerning the ML) is swept aside. It made a mockery of all the angst and misdeeds that was dished out over the last 30 odd episodes. Some were explained away as historical misunderstanding, but more was left unanswered and frankly, baffling. This was quite strange as the bulk of the show was rooted in reality (cooking is about as real as it can get). When the ML was challenged by reporters as to how he can still be a master chef when he can’t even taste his own food, the writer finessed a clever and logical solution. It only served to highlight the inconsistency later on.\nAround that 7/8 mark, we also have an attack of the unicorns as well. We are talking a herd of them. The last few episodes were all about tying every loose end up with pink bows. Happy endings were served to everyone, whether they deserved it or not. This was topped by a Deus Ex Machina solution straight out of a wuxia/xianxia drama. It is as if the writer has abandoned reality, just went all in and damn the consequences. The piece de resistance was the ending. It needs a health warning for diabetics. It was sugar overload. I won’t spoil it, just one hint, Bollywood.\nActing is generally solid but some were exaggerated stereotypes, especially concerning foreigners. Younger actors have room to improve but they show a lot of commitment even when it was an unrewarding role. \nOST and production values were good. It would have scored better if the writer stays focused and kept its message clear. Make it sweet and bubbly or dark and crazy but what we ended up is a rollercoaster ride that looped back on itself and make us feel cheated and confused. Individual scenes can be well executed and acted but the whole is, regrettably, less than the sum of the parts.  ""]",0

"[""I'll reserve my true rating after I watch the whole show. However, I really must address the constant friction between people complaining about subtitles and people supporting the volunteers who do them and attacking subscribers who complain.\n\nAll of you are really looking at the wrong culprit.\n\nBlame VIKI. They have set up the model where volunteers do the subtitles. Sure is cheaper for them. On the other hand? There are millions of subscribers all over the world paying exorbitant subscription fees for ACTUAL SERVICE they don't get!! When I realized that I pay more for VIKI subscription than NETFLIX, it really hacked me off! NETFLIX never makes subscribers wait for translations, nor does the company drag the episodes out interminably. Shouldn't we all demand that VIKI ACT LIKE A GENUINE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, maybe even pay the translators a stipend at least?! I've considered many times dropping VIKI, especially now that there are so many choices for programming and even NETFLIX is picking up lots of Asian content.

"[""Cupid's Skippable Kitchen\n\n**Spoilers are at the bottom**\n\nThis is a Food drama with a pinch of comedy and a very little sprinkle of romance. If you are looking for food then this is the right drama for you. If you’re looking for romance then look elsewhere. This just isn’t it.\n\nFor The Good, For the Bad…\n\nFor the Good:\n1. Colorful Cutscenes - They only did a few of these non-food-related cutscenes but they were beautiful. I was really hoping to see more of them.\n2. High-Quality Food Cutscenes - There are a lot of these and although I enjoyed them. They didn’t feel as satisfying as the ones in Dating In The Kitchen\n3. The Leads - Both are really good actors. I really enjoyed watching them. If not for them I’m not sure I would have watched all 40 episodes.\n4. The OST is very nice\n\nFor The Bad:\n1. Slow-paced - Its very slow-paced and the side stories make it even slower. Other than the first 5 and the last 5 episodes, I found this drama pretty boring.\n2. Huge Lack of Heart-Flutters - Where’s the intimacy? I’m not even talking about kisses. Just moments that make you feel like the leads are falling in love. I certainly felt that they cared for each other but there seemed to be a huge lack of romance.\n3. Boring side-stories - Honestly, I wound up skipping through most of the side stories because they were just so boring, and other than the character knowing the leads, their stories really didn’t affect them or the plot in any real way.\n5. Evil/Bad Character overload - Honestly who isn’t a bad character other than the leads and a few others. However, none of them were as bad as the 2FL who clearly needs mental help. The method she used to try to stay with the ML is one of the most psychotic I’ve ever seen. She’s a basket case and the worst part is that she’s surrounded by enablers. (More on her in the spoilers below)\n6. The 2FL Dubbing - Everyone else in the drama is fine but for some reason, her dubbing is not only obvious but it doesn’t match her mouth movement at all. For all the beautiful production they have in this drama, they very obviously dropped the ball on her dubbing.\n\n\n\n***Spoilers Below***\n\n\n\n\nI really disliked the way the ML took out his frustrations on the FL. I know he is going through something pretty rough but why did he need to yell at her the way he did and more than once. I know he’s devastated over losing his sense of taste but that’s not the FL’s fault.\n\nIn fact, it’s the 2FL’s fault and for some reason instead of thoroughly investigating her. Even when she’s suspiciously asking him if he could forgive the person who poisoned him. The ML even fires his longtime live-in cleaning lady. Someone who was like family to him but he keeps the 2FL around. Furthermore, when he does find out it was her, he completely lets her off the hook!! Like what?!!!\n\nAnother thing that really annoyed me was the ML’s doctor friend who not only hides the fact that the 2FL poisoned the ML into losing his tastebuds and at risk of losing the rest of his senses, but he only enabled her and helps her hide it from being exposed. He deserves to lose his license to practice medicine and go to jail another with the 2FL. I have no sympathy for him no matter how much he likes the 2FL.\n\nIt annoys me that no one got in any sort of real trouble for their bad behavior. Everything is sunshine and rainbows at the end.\n\nThe cutest thing in this romance drama is probably the husky puppy in the last episode…\n\nWould Not Recommend\nWould Not Re-Watch""]",0

"['I like watching dramas that feature cooking and this one didn\'t disappoint in that regard.  Chinese cooking is actually pretty complex. \n\nThis series dragged on and could have been a few episodes shorter.\n\nThe characters:\n1)  Lin Ke Song:  her ""kind"" personality went a bit too far.  If someone stabbed me in the back more than once, even if it was family, the relationship is done.  It\'s like she never learned or put two and two together.  Being forgiving is one thing, but in the leading lady\'s case, I think she could have knocked her cousin down a peg or two without resorting to the same despicable means -- this would have better shown how she is maturing.\n\n2)  Jiang Qian Fan:  overall played his part well.  I can\'t imagine being a chef and then losing your sense of taste and your sight.  I don\'t think he and the leading lady had any chemistry which was huge for this series as the storyline has them spending so much time together.  This story seemed to have missed the building of feelings between the two characters.  We saw a bit of it with Lin Ke Song, but with Jiang Qian Fan, it was blurted out at the end.\n\n3)  Elise:  by far the worst performer in this series.  Too phoeny, seemed like she tried too hard to convey her emotions in all of her scenes and it just came off un-naturally awkward.  Too much dubbing for her character that was badly out of sync.\n\n4)  Lin Xiao Yu:  it is inherent in her personality that she ended up doing what she did and Boris\' style of \'teaching\' just brought those malicious feelings and actions to the surface.\n\n5)  Boris:  eccentric and played his part well.  Came clean at the right time.\n\n6)  Victor:  the only character that, I think, matured throughout the series.  He started off vicious by switching Lin Ke Song\'s ingredient in the first competition, but when he learned the truth of his sister\'s actions, he didn\'t agree with it, but due to family loyalty, he kept silent.  \n\n7)  JunBin:  this character was a doctor -- in all the other Chinese medical dramas that I\'ve seen, the doctors all take patient client priviledges seriously, but this guy didn\'t hesitate to reveal Jian Qian Fan\'s condition to Elise, who he has a crush on and thus also helped to cover up her crime, which makes him an accessory.\n\nStoryline:\nHaving the story center around a chef who loses his sense of taste and later his sight is a huge challenge, but a good storyline.  The secondary storyline unfortunately centered around stereotypical ""scheming and plotting"" characters, namely the Quetins, which was disappointing because none of them paid for their mistakes. \n\nElise should have been publicaly exposed for poisoning Jiang Qian Fan and then subsequently trying to cover her crime up.  Her attempts to steal the restaurants from Jiang Qian Fan with the encouragement from her mother should have also been exposed.  Public humiliation and a ban from the culinary industry in China should have been her punishment, but she gets off pretty much scot free and only spent a short time in jail. because Jiang Qian Fan didn\'t press charges.  Additionally, she should have been called out for her lies that she told about Lin Ke Song.\n\nElise\'s brother Victor should have been exposed in switching the ingredients during the first competition, which could have played a part in his aggression and over arrogance to win.\n\nJunbin, as a doctor, should have also been exposed as trying to help Elise cover up a crime.  He should have lost his license to practice in China and then ended up leaving the country with Elise at the end.\n\nI loved seeing all the food, but the story was just so so.']",1

I've also gone back to see what irks me so much about this show besides the unethical and immoral people. I really don't like the acting of the 2nd female lead (ex GF).  It's hard to believe that much screentime to given to the antagonist who's acting was so bad and inconsistent that it became so distracting that i hated every scene she was in.  Even her ooh so happy scene.\n\nThis story could have been so much better.  It could have skipped all the illogical evil and went with the flow of life. Make it more realistic, and it would have been so much more.  What a loss of what could have been a great piece with bad after bad unecessary drama.\n\nI've said not to recommend before.

Rollercoaster of unnecessary drama and emotions that did no justice to the actual storyline. This show deviated so far off track that I had to remind myself to watch the next episode. \n3. The female lead did not fit this particular drama. I don’t know if it was because of the obvious age gap but she reminded me of a very young teenager. I seriously doubt that a very young and immature-looking female, is what the directors were going for. My unfavorable review is not to discredit the actress but more so the role she was cast for. \n4. The so-called bad guys never received any retribution. I prefer to watch the good guys get the last laugh. \n5. It just seems so unfinished. \nWhen he (ML) loses his taste and becomes blind it is later recovered in the last 20 minutes of the final episode. \n6. The second lead female assistant was the most atrocious character played by what seemed to be a very inexperienced actor. \n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons as to why someone may love it but my cons outweighed my pros. \nI love the ML but I would prefer to watch him on something else.

On the one hand, in an ideal world, I do think that it would be great if it were possible to be this forgiving for people who commit evil deeds if they were genuine about changing, but the problem is that so often people don't want to change and I just unfortunately find it unrealistic and maybe even a bad idea if there are no consequences because of that. It's an issue of boundaries to me - there have to be some lines that people are not allowed to go past without serious consequences. I was unsatisfied with not just how lightly Elise got off, but also how many people supported her and made things easier for her and protected her while she was doing bad things. Where is the moral integrity of her mother? The doctor, Junbin?\n\nIn contrast, I was more satisfied with Boris and Xuanyu's redemptive arcs.

I almost didn’t start this because I am not a fan of the lead actress, however she actually did a great job of acting. Unfortunately they just had to add an annoying voice-over narration for her character which for me was kind of an insult to her acting skills. Totally unnecessary. I started watching it solely for Ethan Juan and he also did a great job with his character. It was too bad for both actors that this drama was such a mess. It was loaded with too many crazy, unrealistic villains and too many unnecessary side stories. The lead villains were the crazy Russian version of The Joker from Batman, and the psycho business partner cum ex girlfriend of the LM. They were so endlessly over-the-top crazy that it became comedic. Add to them a mother from hell, a narcissistic, ruthless son, a doctor with no ethics, and a cousin who was more likely related to Charles Manson than the sweet LL. The drama ended up being all about the evil doings of some bat-sh-t crazy antagonists and a bunch of boring, uninteresting side stories. Even the main story of the chef and apprentice kind of wandered around, with some confusing dream sequences which were just thrown in here and there. It had me fast forwarding and hoping the ending was great, but alas it was disappointing and kind of weird. The best things this drama produced were a lot of beautiful videography of food and a cute ‘dance scene’ at the end. Cupid’s Kitchen was a poor title for this drama.']",1

Lin Ke Song has been friendzoned by Song Yi Ran, her best friend of over 10 years.  After losing her job, she decides to follow him to Shanghai.  Even though this drama is a romance between Jiang Qian Fan and Lin Ke Song, another arc is the personal growth experienced by these two best friends: one wanting first to become someone worthy of her crush, and the other motivated to be better after seeing his best friend’s dedication and growth.  I appreciate how the romance between Qian Fan and Ke Song is handled: a slow progression from respect, trust, friendship to romantic love.  Since he’s much older and more worldly than her, the pacing of their romance is just right and this allows for Ke Song to mature not only as a person but also grow her culinary skills.  What’s a 40-episode drama without a lot of drama and villains? This has plenty of quite obnoxious characters, but that is what makes a drama worthy of watching since these terrible characters act as foils to the heroes/heroines of the story.  Although I feel that the ending was shortened/rushed and the bad guys not punished enough (does that say something about me personally?), I think I can understand that the writers aim for this drama to be about healing, forgiveness, and learning to move on.

All kinds of love...and what can happen in people's lives when they learn what it really means to care for themselves, their families, chosen professions and most of all, the person who is in their hearts. It is a story of jealousy and pride and how destructive they can be when they are allowed to grow inside the soul. It is also a story of forgiveness and how healing it can be for everyone. The setting in the world and art of food is shown with great beauty from the opening to the end credits. The music was perfect for them both.

The story had a good premise and promise, but it turned weird and unbelievable.  I thought this story would be more sophisticated and clever, and thought it would delve deeper into the issues. Thankfully the supporting cast and their stories held the show up. I enjoyed them all, even Xiayou had a relatable back story, and even Boris turned out well at the end. There's a scene where ML tells his ex he is going to get back with her - and then a following episode  he is with the new love interest - and no confrontation with the ex about this?  it's so weird and fragmented.\nI also can't condone some of the awful behaviour of the ML. ( I don't find these things romantic and actually a turn off) The treatment of a loyal housekeeper, the explosive rage, the locking up, the starvation techniques, the confiscation of the phone.\n\nBUT so many criminal acts that never had any visible consequences - that turned me off so much.  Actually, I think there was 1-2 episodes at the end that were not aired - parts of the end story seemed to be just 'not there' I thought I missed some episodes.

It’s 2022 and there are unfortunately still dramas like this being produced. This type of drama content may have been popular in the early 10s when rich jerk of a male lead who is arrogant and very dubious and stupidly dumb doormat of a female fall in love. Then there is the second male leads who are usually oblivious and annoying but turn out okay at some point. Then we have the evil step sister of a second female lead who goes to great lengths to ruin the male lead and female lead at all costs because she can’t have the male lead so no one else can. The fact that they never get punished either and someone who was coerced into doing one or two things that weren’t even bad end up having harsher punishments than someone who made someone else lose their taste and go blind is insane.

"['I was excited to watch this drama because of Ethan Juan since I do not know the other actors/actresses. Unfortunately this fell short as a romantic comedy and  for a drama. I agree with many others that 40 episodes is too long especially with a rushed ending to wrap each pair together. \n\nThe story line was unrealistic. I’m not sure how one can “take taste away” via diffusing an essential oil. The mysterious supplier was never revealed or resolved in the drama either. There may have been several antagonistic characters but there was moral at the end…Mrs. Quentin wanting to protect her children, the doctor wanting to protect Elise, etc etc…While they didn’t add too much to the drama it didn’t bother me as much as the plot between the ML and FL. I thought they had great chemistry. There were some sweet scenes but would’ve liked more development of them as a couple. At the very least, the FL should have been portrayed as completing culinary school and able to stand alone as a chef. \n\nThe sugar theme, however was handled well. It started with the ML losing taste for sweetness and then regaining his taste for sweet. A sugarless restaurant to ending with a dessert party. The musical like ending didn’t bother me too much as it seemed fitting. ']",1

Usually it\'s guessable when the two main leads will confess their feelings but this show threw me off. I didn\'t expect the show to be almost over before they were an official couple. Which was both nice and aggravating. I will admit that I found the episodes before they got together to be more intriguing because the flirting was here, there, and everywhere. I didn\'t like most of the characters at all which was saddening. I think out of the whole cast I only liked Qianfan, Kesong, Kesong\'s uncle, Blu, Blu\'s mentor, Thomas, Song Yiran, Chu Ting, K, and sometimes Boris just because he was so charismatic. I didn\'t like Victor until the end when he met K and I feel like he\'s always given the same roles where he\'s tofu on the inside but doesn\'t quite know how to express his feelings so he comes off harsh. I didn\'t understand why they had to make almost every character have a love story but I guess that\'s why they called it ""Cupid\'s Kitchen"". It was probably more dramatic than it needed to be and some of the scenes or even whole episodes could have been cut out. Also like most Chinese dramas, almost everything gets magically sorted out in the last couple of episodes no matter how much it doesn\'t make sense.']",1

Some may say the pairing of the two leads were odd but their relationship grew on me and became something very sweet to watch. There was a real depth to their love and the chemistry was most evident in the final few episodes. A tearjerker for me. This made the series worthwhile and memorable for me. I loved the dancing and fun ending. Loved how all the couples came together. Sweet drama with silly moments. Made me hungry!'],0
"[""I finally watched all of it but, I never really stopped yelling at the screen.  Like others have mentioned, too many people get away with what they did/are.  I would have to give this over to bad writing.  I think I am finished with Chinese dramas.  Their society is so sheltered and controlled they just don't have a grasp on so much of life and when it comes to writing these shows/dramas - it is very clear that they guess their way through most of it.\n\nBetter than most Chinese dramas.  They did spend lots of money on this one and use it wisely.  We get a major education on food and how it is so different depending on where you are from (villages/provinces).  \n\nI still feel this could have been so much shorter.  So much wasted time with stuff that didn't have anything to do with the rest of anyone's story.  The dubbing and such is so bad that one character has the amazing ability to sound like someone else each time he sings.  It's a bit unnerving.  When that type of scene would start, I would skip past it.  LOL  \n\nWhile some dramas have made the food another character, this one keeps food as a backdrop.  It is discussed as if it is important to everyone but, while we do learn many things as the too many episodes plod along - we just watch people cut, prep, cook and eat while they go through the motions.  We learn the most through Ethan.\n\nI agree with some of the other reviews that this story has too many bad people getting away with what they've done.  I figured out the main evil person (who cares why she is doing it) so early that I've grown frustrated with the constant revelations and them dragging everything out.  Why do so many people end up getting hit by buses, trucks, and cars in K-Dramas but, Elise can't wander into a busy street in this one?\n\nLove the main characters and a couple of the side stories.  This was clearly made to be a travelogue type story.  Get people interested in visiting the area and trying all the different kinds of food.  It takes time to get used to Song Zu Er - she can be quite annoying and immature - her growth takes much longer than traditional Asian dramas - she seems to backslide into the childish realm a bit too often - petty.\n\nI'll stick with it but, I am starting to fast forward through the time filler stuff so, I can focus on the main stories.  There is enough there to keep you interested but, know you will get frustrated and might start throwing things at your screen.""]",0

It\'s becoming annoying. She could at least (pretend), show  some improvement in her handling of the knife-cutting, slicing ot the ingredients for the show. And they don\'t focus on what the contestant is making individually. And the end product of the FL is not what they\'re practicing about. Far from it. I think the writer or the the director of this drama is at fault. I have seen several other dramas abt cooking competitions  but are much better presented. And is the ML that stupid to be deceived(many times) by that restaurant partner of his. Poisoned to keep him by her side. What a load of ....!

The way they developed  his relationship with the 2nd F lead is bizarre.  Not because she is off the chart psycho but because they have stopped any romantic attraction between him and the F lead.  The immature 2nd M lead matured so much and looking much more attractive than the M lead.  Finished this series (on youtube) it was not satisfying.

Dude is old enough to be her dad practically. \n\n I typically would put something like this under a spoiler but I'm hoping that someone will read this and love themselves and not watch this show.

"['The beauty of C-dramas for me is how they champion the idea that extraordinary beauty and achievement in life is the result of ordinary people dreaming big dreams and working hard to make them come true.  That is an important theme in Cupid\'s Kitchen, underscored by beautiful visuals and, in most cases, characters who are ordinary people who succeed because of big dreams and a lot of motivation.\n\nI am not familiar with any of the actors except Ethan Juan. I applaud him for his willingness to become his character, a brilliant loner whose life is  falling apart.  I am not used to him looking quite so scruffy and anti-social (eew on the haircut), but he is quite believable in his role.\n\nIf I have any complaints, it is that some of the romances drag  on far too long in the ""I hate you"" stage and are a little cringe-worthy when the people involved finally realize they care about each other.\n\nAs for the subtitles, I am impressed with the amount of work represented in the English subtitles.  Chinese and English are very different languages with very different ways of expressing the same concepts.  I  have noticed a few  subs that are in good but not idiomatic English, but otherwise the subs have seemed very natural to me and have helped me to enjoy the show.\n\n(And FWIW, people who don\'t like Viki\'s way of subbing, complaining that things done by volunteers are too slow and incomplete, should volunteer to learn subbing and help make the process better and faster.)']",0

"['One of the worst ending dramas I’ve ever watched. If you have the time to kill then watch this show by all means.  You have been warned. :)  The only reason I watched until the end was because of the food/cuisine featured here, although I can tell that this show is trying to subtly promote their food culture. The male and female lead artists were good, the reason for the one star, but not the support—they were a bunch of awkward acting artists.']",1
"['All in all, an interesting and entertaining drama with good chemistry between the various actors and couples.  I would advise not watching it on an empty stomach as the food scenes were drool inducing; the various cuisine shots were definitely a feast for the eyes.  The characters were interesting, although pretty over-the-top in many cases - - the good guys were saints and the villains were evil to the point of being caricatures at times.  Even the little side story couples were fairly interesting, I actually liked the Victor/bicycle girl story the most, even though it was probably the most minor of the romance stories.  I especially liked the parents of the lead actress, they had great chemistry and actually seemed like a real couple.  The two girl villains, Elise and Xiaoyu, did a great job of making me really, REALLY hate them; I absolutely could not stand either of them and just wanted to slap the  out of them every time they appeared, especially Xiaoyu.  It did get draggy and drawn out at certain points but overall, moved along fairly well.  I gave it ten stars because I liked the overall drama and because the person I watched it with (a female) absolutely loved it, but actually, I would only have given it nine stars because . . . the ending, in my opinion, absolutely sucked!  It was such a fogivey, nicey-nice, everyone is forgiven, everyone is intrinsically good inside, ""My Little Pony"" world ending. i.e., EVERYONE ended up happy and forgiven, no matter how evil and reprehensibly despicable they were throughout the show. No one was really punished; the good guys forgave everyone and stopped them from being punished.  There was no real retribution whatsoever.  That may be fine with the people who like these pretentiously over-happy wrap ups, but in my opinion, it is unreal and weakened the overall story and writing.  It is basically saying that you can do all sorts of wicked and evil acts that destroy peoples\' lives, but as long as you say, ""Oh golly, I\'ve been such a naughty, naughty person.  I\'m ever so sowwy.  Can you pwease forgive me?"" Then everything is all right in the world and everyone can be best friends forever!  It is advocating that evil actions should not receive any consequences or punishments as long as the evildoer just apologizes . . . oh puhleeze!  That is NOT the way things are, or should be, in the real world.  Wicked people rarely truly repent, or even feel the slightest remorse, for their self-serving wicked actions, and only ""apologize"" when they are caught in the act and know that their future profits and comfort will be jeopardized.  Their ""apologies"" tend to be little more than self-preserving shows of fake contriteness and are mostly down simply to avoid punishments or consequences of any kind.\n\n  And I also thought the happy ending for the hero was too contrived and that it was obviously going to happen; of course I know it\'s what most viewers wanted, but these contrivances weaken the impact of dramas.  Endings that carry through with a touch of tragedy, although heartbreaking, generally result in better overall stories; two great examples are the Korean dramas, ""The Princess\'s Man"" in which a main character does end up blind, and the outstanding Kdrama, ""Remember"" which had a heartbreaking, but truly powerful ending--because of the tragicness of it.  The heroes in these two shows had sad fates but it strengthened the story and demonstrated the true love of the heroines because they chose to remain with them, and support them, for the rest of their lives; this resulted in a much richer story.\n\nAnyways . . . those are my two main beefs with this show.  But like I said, I did enjoy this drama overall, and my partner LOVED IT (including, and especially, the ending.  She was one of those people who DID want everyone to end up happy and always wants a happy fairy-tale ending).  I think most everyone who watches this show will be pleased with it.  And the food scenes really are drool-worthy.']",1

I have seen the FL in another series that was a college girl role so it was hard at first to view her in a more mature role especially since Kesong starts off more immature at the beginning but as she develops into a more womanly mature role through the story I felt that the actress was able to make me believe it. I had trouble at first with seeing the main couple as a good match with good chemistry but it felt believable by the end. I think the writers went a little wrong with the villains. They did such a good job selling us on how dark hearted they were that it was pretty jarring to have them suddenly flip back into nice people who just made a little mistake and suffered no consequences for their seriously criminal actions. Only poor Li Yan seemed to really suffer and his break-in was mild compared to what the others did. I guess Xiaoyu did suffer some burns but her radical change to sunny, smiley and kind seemed the least believable of all of them. Overall I enjoyed watching this show although I fast forwarded all the boring drawn out food sections of street vendors and food closeups that some other people commented they liked. Each to his own I guess. I agree with others that the very last dance scene was a little odd and didn't seem to match with the music. Maybe it would have seemed better if it was added like a bonus scene after the credits.""]",1

Qualcuno l\'ha paragonata a DATING IN THE KITCHEN,  niente di più sbagliato! Sono 2 cose completamente diverse anche se ambientate in cucina. In ""Dating in the kitchen "" la storia punta principalmente sul romance e sulla storia d\'amore. In Cupid\'s kitchen invece, la storia è incentrata sulla cucina e sulla volontà di imparare e crescere della protagonista e anche del ML. Niente baci appassionati o scene intime, solo qualche innocente bacetto a labbra serrate verso la fine. Ma non è una questione di età o di differenza di età con il ML. Zhao Lusi aveva 22 anni e Lin Shen 40 anni in Dating in the kitchen eppure chi lo ha visto ricorda le loro scene insieme. Purtroppo qui la protagonista sembra una ragazzina di 15 anni ed è proprio questo suo aspetto che era forse inappropriato per scene diverse. Non so se ci saranno i sub ita, per cui l\'ho seguito in inglese. Non esprimo giudizi sul consigliarlo o meno perché i gusti sono soggettivi. Io non lo rivedrei nemmeno con i sub ita. Se volete una bella storia che parli di cibo e cucina, Dating in the kitchen resta inarrivabile.

I find these dramas very Westernized and trying to hard to push these western idles like with the choice of music (some of it very corny). This is way I prefer watching traditional fantasy dramas with actors flying through the air and making make-believe myth stories. My reason for watching Korean, Japanese and Chinese dramas is to experience a different point of view of the world not the same one I am living in here in the USA. It's so obvious that they are marketing to Westerners and of course young gullible girls and it's about making money.  The Chinese need to make their own dramas and stop copying and taking from Korean and Japanese dramas.
